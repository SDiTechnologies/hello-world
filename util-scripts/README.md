# Utility Scripts

### __Overview__
Purpose: serve as home to some useful sample bash and python scripts that partially automate some of the more rudimentary routine processes.

**NOTE:** At this time the only supported script types include bash and python, but that may not always be the case as Powershell is becoming quite popular. Let's avoid older languages like Perl for the time being though.

### __Files__

- create-certificate.sh - incomplete, but practical self-signed certificate generation for ssh and ssl.

- run-jupyter.sh - self-explanatory file name. script for launching jupyter notebooks.

- update-pip-packages.sh - a nasty hack from hackernoon to update all pip packages of an environment to their latest version. __(This will break things; be sure to create a python requirements.txt file before running)__


### __create-certificate.sh__
